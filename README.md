# Desktop-Switcher
An easy way to switch desktops from terminal.

If you keep your virtual desktops organized then you'd know how painful it is to switch desktop on windows.
The experience isn't any better on mac os too.

well, it's now easier on windows, select the desktop u want to switch to, and switch right away based on choice.
a handy tool ig, i'll be merging it with helpbro anyways. 



I'd like to thank @JariPennanen https://github.com/Ciantic
