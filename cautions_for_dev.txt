1) always include the heema-icons.ttf file along with the executable otherwise it won't work, or add it in the installer in future.
2) always include the ttkextrafonts form libs idk why but for some reason pyinstaller doesn't recognize it.
3) don't keep it in user/system32 it won't work as it needs permission.
4) stay calm and keep coding, life is too short to waste on only code.
